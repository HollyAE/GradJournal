# Repository Overview:

This repository contains the code for the mobile application I made as part of my final year dissertation at university. 

Further details are included within the src folder, including how to run the application. However, as of April 2025, the application can no longer be run on the Expo Go app for iOS due to differing SDK versions. 

The app can still be run on an Android emulator and also potentially on the Expo Go app for Android (although I am unable to verify this at this point in time as I don't have an Android to test with).
